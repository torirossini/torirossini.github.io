        <h1>Hello, hello!</h1>
        <p>I'm Tori Rossini, and I do a lot of things.</p>
        <p>I'm a gameplay programmer, a game designer, and an automation engineer. My career goals currently are to join a larger game company starting in engineering, eventually transitioning into a project management role. While I enjoy programming, I enjoy organizing teams and facilitating them to have the most success they possibly can. However, in order to do that, I want to have more experience as an engineer or a designer!</p>
        <p>I am heavily involved in Computer Science House at RIT, a living-learning organization. In this organization, I served as the Social Director for the 2018-19 term, and was able to accomplish a lot to further and preserve the organization. Now, I've picked up the role of project manager and art team lead for our project for the Imagine RIT festival.</p>
        <p>Whenever I'm not working, I'm usually playing video games or having friends over for dinner parties. I just love to cook for people! I also love streaming on Twitch with friends, and playing visual novels with groups of people and voice acting them. I also enjoy drawing, so if I have the opportunity, I love to do different kinds of art for games or for fridge doodles. Maybe I'll toss some up on this site later... </p>
        <p>I'm currently in my third year of college, studying Game Design and Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I will graduate in May 2021.</p>
