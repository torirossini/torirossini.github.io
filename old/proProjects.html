        <p>I worked on Cyberdrive 2077 after my freshman year of college. With a team of six, I worked as a gameplay programmer and acted as the Quality Assurance lead for the team. Our team prototyped games and themes which we thought would be popular around the time of release (Spring 2019), and led the concept through the first phase of development.</p>
        <h4>My Contributions</h4>
        <h5>World Generation - Design and Implementation</h5>
        <p>I worked with our lead designer to design the initial framework for how the world would be generated infinitely. We researched infinite runner gameplay and phase design. We wanted an infinite world which varied in its contents, but not out of scope to build for.We decided to generate the world using tile prefabs which were stitched together as the game progressed. When a tile falls out of view, it is destroyed. We preload tiles out in front of the player and keep them disabled until they are close enough to see them through the fog. All tiles are preinstantiated in pools before the first level starts, and as the game progresses, tiles for later levels are loaded.</p>
        <p>The tiles were loaded in phases for each "sector", which was later renamed to "node". These are essentially levels within the game. With each new node, we would introduce new obstacles and challenges. Within each node, the player will traverse through phases of the level designed to keep them enticed and entertained, without pushing them away either from boredom, or from fear that the game is too difficult.</p>
        <h6>Phases</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Warm up - Allow the player to discover the new landscape without much danger of dying. Enjoy the scenery!</li>
          <li>Calibrate - Player experiences obstacles they've discovered previously. Gets them ready for upcomming challenges.</li>
          <li>Reward - Some kind of reward for dodging obstacles, point pick ups or ramps, to make the player feel good before the next phase</li>
          <li>Challenge 1 - Introduce new obstacles for the node.</li>
          <li>Challenge 2 - Introduce new animated obstacles for the node.</li>
          <li>Rest - The player rests before the next node. This occurs when the player hits a large obstacle which signifies the end of a level, and when they drive through it, they emerge in an open field which will transition into the next "warm up" phase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our lead designer has some awesome diagrams and descriptions on <a href="https://trishasurve.wixsite.com/portfolio/endless-runner">her portfolio site</a> if you are interested!</p>

        <h5>Playtesting and Atomic Variables - Design</h5>
        <p>I held a lot of playtests with other developers, team members, and our core audience as well. I created spreadsheets and kept variables for speed, field of view, density of obstacles, etc. I had a process for playtesting where for each player, I would have them play two versions of the game. With each version, I would tweak one variable, and ask them which version of the game "felt better".</p>
        <p>For example, I would have one build where the speed of the player was 300, and one where it was 200. Each player would tell me which build they liked better, and if I had tested with 20 people, and 70% of people liked the build with a speed of 300, and 30% liked the build with a speed of 200, I could set the speed to 270 and test with the players again. Most of the time, the testers who I would test this third build with would like it just as much if not better than the original two. I could rinse and repeat this process to get more accurate and appropriate base numbers for our atomic variables.</p>
        <p> Another think I learned with this was that the field of view during gameplay drastically affects how fast the game feels. If you increase the field of view suddenly, the player appears to go much faster, and the obstacles stretch to fit the field of view. Often if I changed the field of view for the game, I would recieve feedback that "the player moves too fast". It also gets very disorienting if the field of view is set too high, and the player cannot accurately determine whether or not they can dodge an obstacle. I was able to use this to my advantage when implementing...</p>

        <h5>Ramps - Design and Implementation</h5>
        <p>I implemented ramps into the game to add some variations to the way the player sees the world. With ramps, the player can ride off them and be sent into the air and increase their speed. Later hoops were implemented to have the player soar through them.</p>
        <p>Some of the technical challenges were having the player ride up the ramp as if they were actually riding on the ground. The car isn't hed to the ground with gravity, and as a matter of fact, it isn't even the car that is moving. The world moves <i>towards the player.</i> I implemented ramps so that when the player collides with the front of a ramp, their y position lerps to the max height, hangs for a moment, and then lerps back down to normal height. There are additional speedlines and a field of view increase to create the illusion of speed.</p>
        <p>During playtests, we ran into players going off of ramps and dying to an obstacle they hit in midair. This was an issue since ramps were supposed to be a fun way to reward the player, by making them feel really cool, powerful, and fast while they were in the air. This purpose is destroyed if players avoid ramps for fear of an extreme difficulty increase. We allowed the player to have invulnerability while they are in the air to combat this.</p>

            <h5>Quality Assurance</h5>
            <p class="mb-5">As the QA Lead for the Cyberdrive 2077 team, I wrote the build verification tests we used to test our builds. I would test on many generations of Android devices in order to make sure that we wer keeping our framerate high, even on maximum settings on the slowest devices. I ran manual tests twice a week for all mechanics and functionality contained in the game and in the menus. I would track bugs in a Google sheet and assign priorities and severities accordingly. If there was ever a bug which made gameplay near impossible or too difficult, I would be the one to say that we wouldn't be releasing the build that day. I would often talk with other programmers about what was broken with the code and how I thought it could be fixed, but usually I could just fix the code myself, since I was also a programmer. Even so, delegating tasks to the right people and explaining to them what the issues were helped with my communication skills.</p>
